a key feature is the report standardiser:
bs_standardizer = BalanceSheetStandardizer()
is_standardizer = IncomeStatementStandardizer()
cf_standardizer = CashFlowStandardizer()

income statement:
Revenues - CostOfRevenue = GrossProfit
OperatingExpenses: SG&A + other operating expenses
AllIncomeTaxExpenseBenefit: provision for taxes or taxes
NetIncomeLoss: actual income. after operating cashflows. 

Cashflow:
recall that 'accounting' costs, such as depreciation are usually added back in cashflow since no actual cash  expense was registered for the depreciation. 
also taxes - often a difference between when tax liabilty recognised to when actually paid (buffet called this an interest free loan). 
simmilarly, while giving workers stocks (sharebased compensation) is registered as a cost, it doesn't actually involve cash.
recievables: how much they are owed. means that of the profit registered, some hasn't actually been collected as cash. so when increase - a cash outlfow. 
accounts payable is the opposite: the comapny owes (registered cost) but actaully still has the cash. ditto accrued liabilaties. 


NetCashProvidedByUsedInFinancingActivitiesContinuingOperations: everythin the registered under financing activities: debt payment and issuance, stock, dividende etc
